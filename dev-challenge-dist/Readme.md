High Level Approach to the solution
====================================

Major challenge in this problem statment is to update the table at regular intervals when data is recieved
from web-socket.

1. Overhead is involved in DOM manipulation, we cannot afford to build the DOM again and again becuase DOM repainting is complex task, so there is a need to minimze the DOM lookups and repainting.
 
    Solution
    ==========
    1. I am building table row html and storing it "key"(html) in data itself which is recived from stomp server.
    prepareTableRowMarup() function in TableDrawer.js is doing this task.

    2. Then I am sorting the data array on lastChangeAskBid field, in sortTableData() function, TableDrawer.js
    3. Follwed by accumulating the entire table HTML in prepareSortedTableMarup().
    4. At last I am making a single DOM lookup and replacing the table html with updated dataSet which is sorted on lastChangeAskBid.
    
    updateTable(html) is updating the table.


2. To build Sparkline I am appending a new div with correspond id same as name field.
    and drawing sparkline on the each interval. I am flushing out midPrice data on every 30 seconds because we need to maintain sparkline based on data collected in last 30 seconds.
    
    createSparkLine() function, TableDrawer.js creates sparkLine.
    flushMidprice() function, TableDrawer.js is flushing midPrice array.

I have created short functions to follow SRP.
